      <p className='text-center mb-10'>We created PRIME to showcase what happens when rivals come together as brothers and business <br /> partners to fill the void where great taste meets function.  ​

We dropped <br /> our first product, PRIME Hydration in 2022 and since then, <br /> we've continued to work countless hours to expand in retailers, reach new markets and formulate <br /> new products we know you'll love. ​

We’ve been humbled by the process of  <br />creating a real brand & surpassing some of the biggest beverage companies in the world. <br />As underdogs, we always cherish the opportunity to show the world what’s possible. ​

Now <br /> that we’re both fighting for the same team, we truly believe the sky is the limit. ​
